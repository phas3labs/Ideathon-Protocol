# Ideathon Protocol
n.b. This ideathon was run over a weekend from 12pm UTC Friday 22nd July to 12pm UTC Sunday 24th July

## Where to start
1. Meet your team – introduce yourselves and get to know each other! We suggest making a group chat on Discord and arrange a call if possible. If you’re still looking for a team, check the #team-formation channel in the phas3 Discord. For help finding a team, please do not hesitate to reach out!
2. Brainstorm ideas with your team – start thinking about how your ideas will fit into the [Key Themes](#key-themes) (below). If possible, please document this stage and send it to us with your submission – here’s a few ideation techniques if you’d like some inspiration for this step. We would like to encourage you to think big and be speculative. This [systems thinking resource](https://github.com/phas3labs/Ideathon-Protocol/blob/main/Ecological-Systems-Thinking.md) may help.
3. Choose the idea you would like to build out during the event
4. Work through the below team tasks to build out your idea. We suggest familiarising yourself with the [submission](#submission) and [judging](#judging) criteria before this, and keeping this in mind!
5. Submit your entry by 12pm UTC Sunday 24th July 

## Key Themes
1. Supporting sustainable economies
2. Female empowerment & protection
3. Humanitarian response
4. Climate change & protection of nature
5. Global health

## Team tasks
1. Identify the theme/s your idea fits within (see [Key Themes](#key-themes) above)
2. Describe the problem you are solving and how your chosen idea will address this. Please relate this to your theme/s.
3. What impact might your idea have? Please relate this to your theme/s.
4. Outline the context of the idea. Think about:
    * Is the solution aimed at a particular community, country or countries?
    * Do you understand the context in which the solution is to be deployed (e.g. low trust system, remote community, local cultures and traditions)? Is the idea complementary to relevant ways of doing and knowing?
    * Have any similar projects been attempted before? What was the outcome?
5. Discuss how communities might be involved. Think about:
    * Will the community or people that the idea is aiming to benefit have an active role in co-creating or governing it?
    * Do these communities have access to the necessary hardware, software and expertise to co-create, govern and/or access the solution?
    * Could there be any detrimental impact on equality?
6. Outline the technology that your idea will use. Think about:
    * Are web3 tools the best possible way to address the problem and create your desired impact?
    * What might an alternative without web3 look like (e.g. a co-operative organisation) – what does web3 add?
    * Could the idea meet the [Digital Public Goods Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/)?
7. Outline any risks associated with the idea. Think about:
    * What are any possible negative consequences and how might they be mitigated?
    * Can any lessons be learnt from similar projects?
    * What might be the environmental impact of the project, and where might these be felt?
    * Who is accountable for any risks?
8. Outline the logistics of the idea. Think about:
    * What would a pilot look like?
    * What might be the lifecycle of the project (including an exit plan, if relevant)?
    * How would you evaluate the impact of the project over its lifecycle?
    * Could the solution be replicable elsewhere?
9. Is there anything else your team would like to share?
10. Submit by 12pm UTC Sunday 24th July (details provided below)

## Submission
You can submit your answers to the above tasks in whichever format you prefer.
For example, we are happy to receive documents, videos, slide decks and collaboration boards (to submit in an alternative format to these, please check with us first).

A team of judges will choose the winner of each prize. Teams are eligible for more than one prize. We will aim to notify winners by Monday 1st August.
