| **Name** | Ideathon for International Development (ID3) |
| **Theme / Problem Statement** | To crowdsource ideas for how web3 could shape our society in the future (year 2025) with a focus on international development. The themes will be based on the provocations. |
| **Target Audience** | Grassroots teams from diverse backgrounds. This includes: Members from the DeFi, DeSci, Data and ReFi movement; Members from diversity & inclusion DAOs; Members from location specific DAOs |
| **Benefits of taking part** | The winning teams will all receive a prize to help them develop their ideas further. Ideathon winners will receive a POAP NFT for winning. All participants will receive a POAP NFT for taking part. All participants will have membership to the phas3 community.|
| **Location** | Online (Zoom; Discord) |
| **Date & Duration** | Over the weekend: Friday to Sunday. <br> Kick-off at 12pm on the Friday (22nd): kick off call & talks (recorded for those who can’t attend) <br> Submissions due 12pm of the Sunday (24th)|
| **Early access/Registration** | Signups are free via a Typeform |
| **Teams** | Solo to max no. of 5 team members |
| **Criteria** | **Originality & Innovativeness of the idea:** The idea doesn’t have to be novel, but we want ideas that are backed up by evidence or context to provide a convincing narrative as to why this ‘could’ happen by 2025. <br> **Potential impact:** What benefit or impact would the idea have to those targeted? How many people’s livelihoods could be improved by your idea? Have you considered the potential dystopian impact of your idea? <br> **Scalability:** does your proposed solution have the potential to be scaled at different geographical levels, preferably at the community level, sub- nationally or even nationally? Could your idea have additional spinoffs? <br> **Commercial Viability & Feasibility:** The ability of your idea – product or service – to compete effectively and to make a profit in the long-run. Is there a sustainable business in the idea? <br> **Multi-sectoral collaboration:** Participation of both the public and private sectors is fundamental and collaboration of multi-disciplinary sectors such as finance, water, clean energy and humanities will be an added advantage. <br> **Environmental conservation:** Harnessing the power of the business solution while conserving the natural ecosystem e.g. using environmentally friendly chains or offsetting carbon. <br> **Youth & Women:** The empowerment of young people and women is key to addressing developmental challenges. Therefore, ideas that support these two demographics are greatly encouraged. |

| **Support and mentoring** | We will use our existing network for support & mentoring (including a talk at the kick-off event about the wider context of international development; and being on hand via discord throughout the duration of the hack) during the event and a speaking event (hosted during the kick-off) will be organised to kick off the event. |
